========

This repository contains the inputs and outputs of the predictions of the regulatory network of 41 TFs on 51 S. meliloti strains and 5 related rhizobial species.

Directories
-----------

* genomes: genomic sequences, in GenBank format
* regulators: TFs position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs)
* predictions: filtered predictions for each TF on each genome
* orthologs: pangenome structure of S. meliloti and between S. meliloti and the related rhizobial species
* operons: operon predictions
* replicons: contig mapping for the S. meliloti draft genomes
* networks: regulatory networks, including operon and pangenome information
